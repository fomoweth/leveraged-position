# Leveraged Position

LeveragedPosition is a position management contract that allows users to create leveraged positions using Uniswap V3 pools and lending protocols like Aave V3 and Compound V3.

## Contract Overview

### Configurator

The Configurator is a core registry contract designed to manage protocol contract addresses and their implementations. It supports deploying and upgrading proxies and implements a modular architecture inspired by Aave V3.

### PositionDeployer

The PositionDeployer contract is a factory for creating LeveragedPosition contracts, enabling users to deploy positions permissionlessly.

### PositionDescriptor

The PositionDescriptor contract is a utility for generating human-readable descriptions and tickers for LeveragedPosition contracts. It provides clear insights into the underlying assets and protocols associated with a position.

### LeveragedPosition

The LeveragedPosition contract is a position management tool enabling users to create and manage leveraged positions in a decentralized and modular way. It integrates with Uniswap V3 for swaps and lending protocols like Aave V3 and Compound V3 for borrowing and collateral management.

## Usage

Create `.env` file with the following content:

```text
# using Alchemy

ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
RPC_ETHEREUM="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}"

# using Infura

INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
RPC_ETHEREUM="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY}"

# etherscan

ETHERSCAN_API_KEY_ETHEREUM=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
ETHERSCAN_URL_ETHEREUM="https://api.etherscan.io/api"
```

### Build

```shell
$ forge build
```

### Test

```shell
$ forge test --chain 1
```

### Examples

Deploying a LeveragedPosition

- Deploy the **Configurator** and register addresses for key protocols.
- Use the **PositionDeployer** contract to deploy a new **LeveragedPosition** contract with the desired parameters.
- Interact with the deployed **LeveragedPosition** contract to manage liquidity, borrow assets, and adjust leverage.
